# color-picker
nativescript and web app

home.component.ts has to deal with nativescript and angular coz nativescript doesnt' support ngx-color-picker module. we have to use nativescript-color-picker module for nativescript.
may be we need to have a seperated home.component.tns.ts.

this prove to work on android
    tns run android bundle
